During this phase, commanders play a series of narrative focused scenarios in a Swiss-system tournament.
The last scenario should be a large scale event that requires a significant portion of each commander's forces.
In this phase, scenarios may only be 1v1.
Each commander should play a different opponent during each scenario, if possible.
For each 1,000,000 earned during a scenario, the commander earns 1 point for scoring.
The players rankings are updated after each scenario.
Ties are broken by the lowest total BV lost across all scenarios thus far, which \emph{destroyed} units counting as their full BV and units in \emph{forced withdrawal} counting as half their full BV.

At the end of these scenarios, winners are determined by their ranking.
Additional winners may be determined for specific categories, such as Best Painted Force or Best Force Lore.
