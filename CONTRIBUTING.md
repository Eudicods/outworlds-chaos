We welcome suggestions and contributions from new collaborators.

Before creating a Pull Request, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Eudicods/outworlds-wastes/issues) to discuss the proposed change.

Changes involving only code, such as updating the automated build process, can discussed and implimented purely online.
However, changes involving the ruleset need to be playtested before they are accepted.

External collaborators should use the [Fork and Pull](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model) model when creating new contributions.
