Secondary objectives are additional goals added to each track.
Commanders earn 50 SP if their force completes their secondary objective.
In a 1v2 track, the independent commander may have two separate secondary objectives a single secondary objective that they may score twice.

There are three ways to select secondary objectives.
First, a single secondary objective that both sides share could be selected, randomly or by mutual agreement.
Alternatively, each side could randomly roll a secondary objective in secret.
Finally, each player could randomly roll a secondary objective in secret.

The selected secondary objectives must be achievable by the forces selected for the scenario.
If a secondary objective is impossible to accomplish based upon the scenario, map, or enemy force, determine a new secondary objective before play begins.
