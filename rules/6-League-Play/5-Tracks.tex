Event organizers provide tracks, which may be 1v1, 2v2, or 1v2.
Commanders may use different units for different tracks in a contract.

The standard rules given in the \emph{BattleTech: Mercenaries} box set and the \emph{Hot Spots: Hinterlands} sourcebook apply to these tracks, unless the organizers modify these rules.

For 1v1 tracks, commanders may bring up to 7,000 BV (250 PV) of units to each track, excluding the cost of Skill Advances but including any costs of C\textsuperscript{3} and TAG.
If allowed by league organizers, commanders may convert up to 1,000 BV to 50 BSP and run the non-'Mech units as Battlefield Support: Assets; however, Assets may not score objectives.

For 2v2 tracks, each commander may bring up to 3,500 BV (125 PV) of units to each track, excluding the cost of Skill Advances but including any costs of C\textsuperscript{3} and TAG.
Commanders may give any unspent BV to the other commander to use.
If allowed by league organizers, commanders may convert up to 500 BV to 25 BSP and run the non-'Mech units as Battlefield Support: Assets; however, Assets may not score objectives.

For 1v2 tracks, the commanders working together select their units per the 2v2 limits given above.
The independent commander may select their units per the 1v1 limits given above.

On-map artillery or aerospace units may be used if allowed by league organizers.

If allowed by league organizers, commanders get 14 BSP for Battlefield Support: Strikes in 1v1 tracks or 7 BSP in 2v2 tracks.
In 2v2 tracks, commanders may give any unspent BSP for Battlefield Support: Strikes to the other commander to use.
Any unspent BV or BSP may be converted to BSP to use for Battlefield Support: Strikes, unless prohibited by the track rules.
