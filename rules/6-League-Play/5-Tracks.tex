Event organizers provide tracks, which may be 1v1, 2v2, or 1v2.
Commanders may use different units for different tracks in a contract.

The standard rules given in the \emph{BattleTech: Mercenaries} box set and the \emph{BattleTech: Hinterlands} sourcebook apply to these tracks, unless the organizers modify these rules.

For 1v1 tracks, commanders may bring 6,000 BV (170 PV) of 'Mechs to each track, excluding the cost of Skill Advances but including any costs of C\textsuperscript{3} and TAG.
Commanders may bring 1,000 BV (80 PV) of non-'Mech units, plus any unspent BV (PV) from 'Mech units, for a total of 7,000 BV (250 PV).
Commanders may convert the 1,000 BV to 50 BSP and run the non-'Mech units as Battlefield Support: Assets; however, Assets may not score objectives.

For 2v2 tracks, each commander may bring 3,000 BV (85 PV) of 'Mechs to each track, excluding the cost of Skill Advances but including any costs of C\textsuperscript{3} and TAG.
Commanders may bring 500 BV (40 PV) of non-'Mech units, plus any unspent BV (PV) from 'Mech units, for a total of 3,500 BV (125 PV).
Commanders may convert the 500 BV to 25 BSP and run the non-'Mech units as Battlefield Support: Assets; however, Assets may not score objectives.

For 1v2 tracks, the commanders working together select their units per the 2v2 limits given above.
The independent commander may select their units per the 1v1 limits given above.

Commanders get 14 BSP for Battlefield Support: Strikes in 1v1 tracks or 7 BSP in 2v2 tracks.
Any unspent BV or BSP may be converted to BSP to use for Battlefield Support: Strikes, unless prohibited by the track rules.
