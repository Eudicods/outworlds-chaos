In competitive play, commanders play a series of tracks in a Swiss-system tournament.

A commander can only use a single force for the tournament.
League organizers may require new forces for the tournament or allow forces that have been used in narrative play.

Any optional or advanced rules must be agreed upon in advance and consistent across the tournament play.

The tracks in the tournament should only be 1v1.
Each commander should play a different opponent during each track, if possible.
The last track should be a large scale event that requires a significant portion of each commander's forces.

Players are ranked by their Warchest, with ties being broken by Reputation.
At the end of the series of tracks, winners are determined by their ranking.
Additional winners may be determined for specific categories, such as Best Painted Force or Best Force Lore.
