In narrative play, commanders play narrative tracks designed by league organizers and casual tracks between forces.
This is an open ended format that lasts as long as commanders want to play.

At any point, a new commander can join the league or a current commander can replace their force with a new one.
Any new force must follow the Force Construction rules.
A commander may run multiple forces so long as the logistics of each force remain separate.

Optional DropShip Customization and Force Maintenance rules should be consistent across the league; for example, \emph{Design Quirks} should be permitted for all forces or banned from all forces.
Each side should agree upon any available optional or advanced rules for each track they play, such as \emph{Multiple Attack Rolls} or \emph{Special Pilot Abilities}.

Additional restrictions may be enforced by league organizers, such as league play only occurring at a specific location, but any such restrictions must be announced in advance.
