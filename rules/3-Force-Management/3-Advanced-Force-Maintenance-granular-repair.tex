\item {\bfseries Granular Repair}: Calculate the repair costs based upon the percentage of the internal structure damaged.
Armor is still repaired for free.
The repair cost for Omni units is still based upon the fielded variant.
A 5/6 pilot or crew is still included in the repair cost.

For BattleTech, calculate \emph{repair} costs as 50\% of the unit's C-bill cost, multiplied by the percentage of internal sections damaged.
For example, if 2 internal sections have structural damage and another section has a through-armor critical hit that caused critical hit damage, pay 3 / 8 = 37.5\% of 50\% of the C-bill cost of the unit, or 18.75\% of the C-bill cost of the unit.
It would cost 2,113,173 C-bills to repair a Wolverine WVR-7D damaged in this way, instead of 2,817,564 C-bills per the standard \emph{repair} rules.

For Alpha Strike, calculate \emph{repair} costs as 50\% of the unit's C-bill cost, multiplied by the percentage of internal structure bubbles damaged.
For example, if a unit has only 1 out of 3 structure bubbles remaining, pay 2 / 3 = 66.7\% of 50\% of the C-bill cost of the unit, or 33.3\% of the C-bill cost of the unit.
It would cost 3,756,752 C-bills to repair a Wolverine WVR-7D damaged in this way, instead of 2,817,564 C-bills per the standard \emph{repair} rules.
