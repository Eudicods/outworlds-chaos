\emph{\bfseries Support Bays}: A vehicle may be used to convert combat vehicle bay space into DropShip customization levels.
Using a vehicle in this fashion fills the entire bay.
The vehicle must cost at least 500,000 C-bills; if the vehicle costs less, pay the difference to use the vehicle in this way.
Only one level of a type may be added by a vehicle and customization cannot exceed level 3.
The vehicles may be used in scenarios but do not grant a level of customization if \emph{damaged} or \emph{destroyed} unless \emph{repaired} or \emph{replaced}.

\begin{itemize}

\item BattleMech Recovery Vehicles give 1 level of Machine Shop

\item Vehicles with at least 6 tons of MASH equipment give 1 level of Medical Bay

\end{itemize}
