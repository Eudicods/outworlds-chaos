A force can have multiple units with level 1 or level 2 customizations but only one unit with level 3 or higher customizations.
A unit with level 3 or higher customizations counts as the single Unique or Experimental unit allowed in a force.

Commanders purchase the base unit and then pay 200\% of the difference in C-bill cost of the original unit and the computed C-bill cost of the custom unit.
Customization has a minimum cost of 500,000 C-bills or 20\% of the original C-bill cost of the unit, whichever is less.
Custom units may be customized again.
If the custom unit uses Omni technology, the unit can still be configured as a cheaper variant of the chassis at no cost.

Units with level 3 or higher customizations are more expensive to maintain.
Pay 30\% of the C-bill cost to repair a damaged custom unit and 60\% of the C-bill cost to replace a \emph{destroyed} custom unit.

Custom units cannot be purchased as salvage but selling a salvaged custom unit earns 25\% of the computed C-bill cost.
Commanders cannot purchase a custom unit from another commander.
Commanders can sell this custom unit for parts at 40\% of the C-bill cost, or 20\% of the C-bill cost if the unit is destroyed.
