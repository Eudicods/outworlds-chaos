\item {\bfseries Conscripts}: Basic foot infantry (see p. 213, TW) may be treated as conscripts.
Conscripts are free to \emph{recruit} or \emph{replace}, cannot be sold as \emph{salvage}, and must be \emph{purchased} as normal to be added to a force.
These units may be no better than Gunnery 4/Anti-'Mech 5 and cannot have Special Pilot Abilities (SPAs).
Commanders must use the standard rules for infantry with better skills or SPAs.
