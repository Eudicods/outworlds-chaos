\emph{\bfseries Maintenance}: Improve the ability to maintain units of a specific type.
This customization stacks with quirks.
A unit that is \emph{Easy to Maintain} on a dropship with level 1 in maintenance for that unit type is 15\% cheaper to repair or replace while a unit that is \emph{Hard to Maintain} would only be 5\% more expensive to repair or replace.

The maintenance level cannot be adjusted for a unit type not present in the force.
For example, a force must have VTOL units to raise or lower the VTOL maintenance category.
If the last unit of a type is sold or destroyed, commanders must replace the unit with another of the type or immediately pay to reallocate any positive or negative points to reset the category to level 0.
