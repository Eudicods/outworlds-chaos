\item {\bfseries Custom Design Quirks}: If commanders have opted into using \emph{Design Quirks}, they may purchase additional quirks to customize their units.
If a commander uses \emph{Custom Design Quirks}, then the additional quirks always apply to \emph{repair}, \emph{replacement}, \emph{salvage}, and \emph{selling} costs for all units.
Both sides must agree to use \emph{Custom Design Quirks} for them to apply in a scenario.

Pay 10\% of the unit's cost in C-bills per positive quirk point to add a positive quirk.
For each positive quirk, commanders must select negative quirks with a total value greater than or equal to the positive quirk's point value.
Increase the repair and replacement costs by 10\% for each positive quirk point purchased.
See \emph{BattleTech: Campaign Operations}, page 255, for a table summarizing which quirks may be applied to which unit types.

The following quirks may be used to customize your units:
