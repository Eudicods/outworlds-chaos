\item {\bfseries Retrain}: Retrain a pilot/crew to a new unit.
Commanders may retrain a pilot/crew when selling a unit and immediately purchasing a replacement unit of the same type or when exchanging the pilots/crew between two units.

Pay 250,000 C-bills multiplied by the difference in BV skill multiplier between their current skill level and 4/5 to retrain the crew/pilot.
For example, a 3/3 pilot has a BV skill multiplier of 1.44, so it costs 110,000 C-bills to retrain a 3/3 pilot for a new unit.
See \emph{BattleTech: TechManual}, page 315, for the BV skill multiplier table.
Add 250,000 C-bills to the retraining cost for pilots/crew with an SPA.
Each pilot/crew has to be retrained when exchanging the pilots/crew between two units.

The old and new unit must be the same type.
For example, a 'Mech pilot can only be retrained into another 'Mech unit.
A Combat Vehicle crew can only retrain to the same type of Combat Vehicle: ground, VTOL, WiGE, or naval.
See \emph{BattleTech: Total Warfare}, page 192, for discussion of the Combat Vehicle types.
