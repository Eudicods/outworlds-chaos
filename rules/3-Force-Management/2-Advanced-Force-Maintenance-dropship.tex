\item {\bfseries Dropship Customization}: Commanders may customize their dropship to better support their force.
Commanders are encouraged to name their dropship before using this rule.

Each commander receives 5 customization points to modify their dropship.
The dropship starts at level 0 in each category.
Commanders spend customization points to raise the level for a category and gain the corresponding benefit.
Any portion of the initial 5 customization points may be reserved for future use.
The table below details how many points it costs to increase a category customization level.

\end{table}

It costs 1 point to go from level 0 to level 1 and an additional 2 points to go from level 1 to level 2, meaning that it costs 3 total points to go from level 0 to level 2.

Commanders can customize their dropships in the following categories:

\item Ground Combat Vehicle Maintenance

\item VTOL Combat Vehicle Maintenance

Commanders can further customize their dropship, but space and resources must be reallocated from one category to another.
After each scenario, commanders may spend 1,000,000 C-bills to decrease the level of one or more categories to earn sufficient customization points and increase the level of a single category.
The customization points earned when decreasing the level of a category are given in the table above.
This may be done only once between scenarios.
