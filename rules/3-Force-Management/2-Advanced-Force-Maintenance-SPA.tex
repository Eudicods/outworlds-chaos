\item {\bfseries Special Pilot Abilities}: Commanders may opt into using \emph{Special Pilot Abilities} (SPAs) for their units.
If a commander opts into using \emph{Special Pilot Abilities}, then they always apply to retraining costs.
Both players in a scenario must agree to use \emph{Special Pilot Abilities} for them to apply in the scenario.

See \emph{BattleTech: Campaign Operations}, page 70, or \href{https://sarna.net}{Sarna.net} for a list of all SPAs.

After each scenario, roll 2D6 for each unit that survived.
Subtract 2 from the result if the unit already has an SPA.
On a result of 10+, assign an SPA to the unit by rolling D666 on the charts below.
If the result is invalid for the unit, roll D666 again and use the new result.
Commanders may decide to not apply a valid SPA to the unit; however, do not roll again in this case.
An SPA can be removed from a unit, but only after rolling for new SPAs following a scenario.
