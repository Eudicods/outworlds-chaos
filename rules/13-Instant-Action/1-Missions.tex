In order to use \emph{BattleTech: Instant Action} missions as casual scenarios for \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes}, first each side agrees upon a BV limit.
The standard \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} limits of 6,000 BV for 1v1 or 10,000 BV for 2v2 agree with the recommendations for \emph{BatleTech: Instant Action}.

Next, both sides agree upon a Battlefield Support Points (BSP) budget and if Gambits and Conditions are being used.
BSP can be used with or without Gambits and Conditions, and Gambits and Conditions may be used with no other BSP, such as BSP Strikes.

Then, each side selects an agenda and consults the Mission Matrix to determine which mission corresponds to this pair of agendas.
Any special rules for the selected mission given in the Game Concepts section apply.
The mission determines the primary objective.

Finally, each side selects a secondary objective per the instructions in Secondary Objectives subsection of the Scenarios section for \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes}.

The secondary objective is scored as described in the Sceondary Objectives subsection of \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes}.
The primary objective is scored as described below.

\begin{description}

\item {\bfseries Circle of Equals}: Each side earns a proportion of 7,000,000 C-bills based upon the ratio of the percentage of enemy forces \emph{destroyed} by BV by each side.
Units that withdraw do not count as \emph{destroyed} for the purposes of scoring.
Award an extra 15\% to the side who had the last active units on the field during the End Phase, if any.
For example, if the first side \emph{destroyed} 30\% of the enemy BV and the second side \emph{destroyed} 35\% of the enemy BV and had the only active units on the field during the final End Phase, then award 2,625,000 C-bills to the first side and 4,375,000 C-bills to the second side.

If the Hold player earns double the percentage of the Confront player's non-infantry units that are \emph{destroyed} or withdrawing, up to 100\%.
For example, if 28\% of the Confront player's non-infantry units are \emph{destroyed} or withdrawing, then the Hold player earns 56\% of the C-bills, or 3,920,000 C-bills, and the Confront player earns 44\% of the C-bills, or 3,080,000 C-bills.
