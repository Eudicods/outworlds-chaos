\emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} provides a framework for a narrative BattleTech league and events based upon \emph{BattleTech: Chaos Campaign} from the \emph{BattleTech: Mercenaries} box set and \emph{BattleTech: Hinterlands} sourcebook.
Players lead a combined arms force searching the Outworlds Wastes for LosTech and glory.
Commanders play scenarios in multiple formats, such as \emph{BattleTech} and \emph{Alpha Strike}.
This framework can be modified to meet the goals of the organizers and players.
