\emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} provides a framework for a narrative BattleTech league and events based upon \emph{BattleTech: Chaos Campaign}.
Players lead a combined arms force searching the Outworlds Wastes for LosTech and glory.
Completing objectives in scenarios earns Supply Points to maintain and upgrade your force.
Commanders play scenarios in multiple formats, such as \emph{BattleTech} and \emph{Alpha Strike}.
This framework can be modified to meet the goals of the organizers and players.
