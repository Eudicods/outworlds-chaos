\emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes: Chaos Campaign} provides a framework for a narrative BattleTech league and events based upon \emph{BattleTech: Chaos Campaign} from the \emph{Hot Spots: Hinterlands} sourcebook or the \emph{BattleTech: Mercenaries} box set.
\emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} extends the \emph{BattleTech: Chaos Campaign} rules by adding DropShip customization as well as optional rules for force maintenance.
These rules can be used with existing \emph{BattleTech: Chaos Campaign} content and tracks.

Players take the role of a commander for an independent combined arms force.
In \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} narrative tracks, commanders are searching the Outworlds Wastes region of the Periphery for LosTech and glory.
Commanders can play scenarios in multiple formats, such as \emph{BattleTech} and \emph{Alpha Strike}.
This framework can be modified to meet the goals of the organizers and players.

The original format of \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} with a logistics system more similar to \emph{BattleTech: Campaign Operations} is available online at \href{https://outworlds-wastes.jeremylt.org}{https://outworlds-wastes.jeremylt.org}.
