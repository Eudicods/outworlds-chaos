\emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} provides a framework for a narrative BattleTech league with simplified logistics.
Players take the role of a commander leading a combined arms force searching the Outworlds Wastes for LosTech and glory.
Completing objectives in scenarios earns C-bills that commanders use to maintain and upgrade their force.
Commanders play scenarios in multiple formats, such as \emph{BattleTech} and \emph{Alpha Strike}.
This framework can be modified to meet the goals of the organizers and players.
