This list of scenario objectives is not exhaustive.
Commanders may develop and play alternative scenarios as long as the scenarios are not intended to cheat the rules or otherwise give the commanders unfair advantages.
For example, a pair of commanders for Clan forces may agree to a Trial of Possession over a bondsman or a particular unit.

Any additional restrictions or conditions for a casual scenario need to be agreed upon by all commanders before the scenario starts.
The outcome of the scenario can result in transfer of personnel or units between forces if that is agreed upon before the scenario starts.

These alternative scenarios may include a C-bill payment but do not have to.
For example, a duel between two 'Mechs likely would not include a C-bill payment.
If the scenario includes a C-bill payment, it should stay close to the guidelines provided in the Scenario Scoring section.
