There are two ways to select secondary objectives.
First, a single secondary objective that both sides share could be selected, randomly or by mutual agreement.
Alternatively, each side could randomly roll a secondary objective in secret.
In either case, the selected secondary objective must be achievable by the forces selected for the scenario.
If the secondary objective cannot be completed, determine a new secondary objective before play begins.

\begin{enumerate}
