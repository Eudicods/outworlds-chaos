Commanders can convert a force from an event into a full \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} force.
All of the full \ifthenelse{\equal{\outworldsMode}{mode-pdf-event}}{Force Construction}{\hyperref[subsec:force_construction]{Force Construction} rules} rules apply, with the following modifications.

\begin{itemize}

\item Units from the event that are damaged but not \emph{destroyed} are repaired for free.

\item Units from the event that are \emph{destroyed} but not replaced cannot be added to the new force.

\item Units from the event may keep any skill upgrades purchased during the event.
Units from the event may also have their skill levels degraded, if desired.

\item Commanders may change their faction as long as the units from the event are available on the new faction list.
Commanders may use the \emph{Advanced Force Construction} rules to create a custom faction list.

\item Commanders may keep any C-bills earned during the event.
If the force ended the event with fewer than 3,000,000 C-bills, then start with 3,000,000 C-bills.

\end{itemize}
