The Outworlds Alliance was founded in 2413 and largely enjoyed prosperity throughout the Star League Era.
At the start of the Amaris Civil War in 2766, the Outworlds Alliance contained 135 major systems organized into 7 administrative districts.
The Succession Wars that followed the fall of the Star League in 2780 were particularly difficult for the Outworlds Alliance, and they had to abandon systems that they no longer had the resources or infrastructure to support.
By the end of the Third Succession War in 3025, the Outworlds Alliance only had 35 systems remaining.

Clan Snow Raven began exploring the Periphery soon after the end of Operation REVIVAL in 3052.
The Outworlds Alliance  and Clan Snow Raven encountered each other and began developing mutual respect and a tentative alliance in 3064.
Clan Snow Raven took refuge in the Outworlds Alliance following their abjuration from the Clan Homeworlds after the Wars of Reaving in 3075.
In 3083, Clan Snow Raven and the Outworlds Alliance merged to form the Raven Alliance.
By the ilClan Trial in 3151, the Raven Alliance contained 47 systems.

Most of these lost worlds form a region known as the Outworlds Wastes.
The exact number of lost systems varies from era to era, but the Outworlds Alliance has abandoned approximately 90 systems.
Many factions are eager to explore these systems in search of lost Star League technology or to take refuge from the political machinations of the Inner Sphere successor states.
