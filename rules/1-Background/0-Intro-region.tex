The Outworlds Alliance was founded in 2413 and enjoyed prosperity throughout the Star League Era.
By the start of the Amaris Civil War in 2766, the Outworlds Alliance contained over 135 major systems across 7 administrative districts.
The Succession Wars that followed the fall of the Star League in 2780 were particularly difficult for the Outworlds Alliance, and they had to steadily abandon systems that they no longer had the resources to support.

Clan Snow Raven began exploring the Periphery for resources soon after the battle of Tukayyid ended Operation REVIVAL.
In 3064, Clan Snow Raven and the Outworlds Alliance began developing mutual respect and a tentative alliance.
Following their abjuration from the Clan Homeworlds in 3075 after the Wars of Reaving, Clan Snow Raven took refuge in the Outworlds Alliance.
In 3083, Clan Snow Raven and the Outworlds Alliance merged to form the Raven Alliance.
By the ilClan Trial in 3151, the Raven Alliance contained only 47 systems.

The exact number of lost systems varies from era to era, but approximately 88 systems that were part of the Outworlds Alliance during the Star League era were abandoned.
These lost worlds form the Outworlds Wastes.
Many factions are eager to explore these lost worlds in search of lost Star League technology or to take refuge from the complex political machinations of the Inner Sphere.
