League organizers pick the current era for the league; organizers can select any era after the fall of the Star League.
The era determines unit availability and the most common factions present in the Outworlds Wastes.
The Outworlds Wastes offers a lot of narrative options; however league organizers can pick any location that is appropriate for their League.
Commanders should ask the league organizers which era and region their league currently is in.
