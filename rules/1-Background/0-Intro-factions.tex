Commanders should pick the faction they are most interested in representing.
While the common factions listed above are the most prevalent in the region, many other factions may be found in the Outworlds Wastes.
For example, the Raven Alliance has relationships with nations on the far side of the Periphery, such as the Magistracy of Canopus.

Commanders will compete with other factions in the Outworlds Wastes to grow their force and recover lost technology.
Scenarios are primarily designed for BattleTech: Total Warfare, but scenarios for BattleTech: Alpha Strike and other formats are also supported.

League organizers pick the era for the current league; organizers can select any era after the fall of the Star League.
The era determines unit availability and the most common factions in the Outworlds Wastes.
Commanders should ask the league organizers which era is being used.
