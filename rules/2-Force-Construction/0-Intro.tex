Unit commanders start with 10,000 Battle Value points (BV) they can use to purchase their initial units and 3,000,000 C-bills they can use for maintenance after completing their first scenario.
Completing scenarios and accomplishing objectives earns additional C-bills for commanders to spend on training their pilots, upgrading units, and acquiring new equipment.
