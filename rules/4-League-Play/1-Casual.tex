The Casual Play Phase gives commanders the opportunity to play casual scenarios and earn C-bills to upgrade their forces.

In this phase, scenarios may be 1v1 or 2v2.
After each casual scenario, the players can repair and update their forces per the Force Maintenance and Improvements rules.

At any point during this phase, a new commander can join the league or a current commander can replace their force with a new one.
Any new force must follow the Force Construction rules.

This phase has no set duration, and it can run concurrently with other events or leagues.
Commanders should keep track of the outcomes of all scenarios and all changes to their force, such as with the sample record sheets at the end of this packet.
Additional restrictions may be enforced by league organizers, such as league play only occurring at a specific location.
