During the Scoring Phase, commanders play a series of narrative focused scenarios in a Swiss-system tournament.

The scenarios in this phase may only be 1v1.
Commanders may only use C-bills earned during this phase to repair and update their forces per the Force Maintenance and Improvements rules after a scenario.
Each commander should play a different opponent during each scenario, if possible.
The last scenario should be a large scale event that requires a significant portion of each commander's forces.

Each 1,000,000 C-bills earned during a scenario is worth 1 point for scoring.
The C-bills earned includes primary objectives, secondary objectives, and salvage.
The players rankings are updated after each scenario.
Ties are broken by the lowest total BV lost across all scenarios thus far, which \emph{destroyed} units counting as their full BV and units in \emph{forced withdrawal} counting as half their full BV.

At the end of these scenarios, winners are determined by their ranking.
Additional winners may be determined for specific categories, such as Best Painted Force or Best Force Lore.
