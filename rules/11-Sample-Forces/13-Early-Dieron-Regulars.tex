\subsubsection{3rd Dieron Regulars Spears of Nobutsuna - Early Succession Wars Era Draconis Combine Force}

The Draconis Combine has long been known for the skill of its duelists, both in Kenjutsu and in mech combat.
Much to the chagrin of the vaunted Star League Defense Force, the Combine warriors often proved their equal in one on one combat if not their better.

Warfare is on the horizon and the Coordinator knows it.
The collapse of the Star League is inevitable and he has authorized his warlords to create small recon and raiding units.
It is his belief such units will be an invaluable tool to keep the Dragon’s enemies off balance while gathering useful data on their capabilities.

The “Spears of Nobutsuna” are a contingent of the \href{https://www.sarna.net/wiki/3rd_Dieron_Regulars}{3rd Dieron Regulars}.
Led by Ise Shinkuro, the grandson of a noted duelist, they take their name from Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, the reputed founder of the Shinkage-ryu style of swordsmanship.
Ise Shinkuro is a practitioner, as are several other members of the unit.

In marked contrast to most of the Dieron Regulars, the Spears contain members from the Azami people as well as the Rasalhague population.
Of note, Shinkuro recruited members of the Arkab Legion to pilot the company’s hovercraft.
Despite their difference in class and rank Shinkuro is often seen in the Azami crew’s company, in deep discussions about philosophy and swordsmanship.
Several of the Azami are practiced in the scimitar.
