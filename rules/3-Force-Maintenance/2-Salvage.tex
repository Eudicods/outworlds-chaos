This optional rule replaces the Salvage rules given in the \emph{BattleTech: Mercenaries} box set and \emph{BattleTech: Hinterlands} sourcebook.

Each side may salvage destroyed enemy units at the end of a track, unless the Special Rules of the track prohibit this.
Salvaged units are not removed from the opponent's force and may still be repaired normally.
Truly Destroyed units cannot be salvaged and are removed from the opponent's force.

If a commander's contract has 10\% or better Salvage Rights (step 4), they may purchase salvaged units.
Compute the total SP earned from salvage by adding together the selling price of all destroyed enemy units and multiplying by the Salvage Rights percentage.
The commander may use these salvage SP to purchase any of the salvaged units.
Any SP not spent on purchasing salvaged units is added to your Warchest.
