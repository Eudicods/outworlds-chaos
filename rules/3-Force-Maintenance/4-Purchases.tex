The purchase price for units is the BV value in SP, and the selling price is half of the purchase price, as described in \emph{Hot Spots: Hinterlands}.

Organizers may provide a limited list of units available for purchase.
Organizers may periodically update the list of available units.
Some of the units on this list may have limited availability.
If any of the units have limited availability, organizers announce a bidding period for these units.
The minimum bid is half the BV of the unit.
Bids are secret and the commander with the highest SP bid purchases the unit.

Organizers may allow commanders to purchase units from each other.
The selling commander must have the unit in their force and removes the unit after it is sold.

If organizers do not provide a limited list of available units, then commanders may purchase any unit listed on the \href{http://www.masterunitlist.info}{Master Unit List} for their faction in the current era.
