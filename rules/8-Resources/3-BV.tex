BV adjustments are applied in the following order.

\begin{itemize}

  \item Each unit equipped with TAG or a C\textsuperscript{3} master computer adds BV for each ton of semi-guided LRM ammunition carried by all units in the force.

  \item Each unit that is part of a C\textsuperscript{3} network increases its BV by 5\% of the total BV of all units included in the C\textsuperscript{3} network.

  \item Pilot/crew skill levels are not included in the BV for \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes}.

\end{itemize}
