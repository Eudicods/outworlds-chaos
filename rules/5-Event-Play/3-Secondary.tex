Secondary objectives are additional goals added to each track.
Commanders earn 50 SP if their force completes their secondary objective.

If no secondary objective is identified for the track, each commander randomly selected one of the secondary objectives given below.
If a secondary objective is impossible to accomplish based upon the scenario, map, or enemy force, determine a new secondary objective before play begins.
For example, if the enemy force has no ProtoMechs, reroll if you randomly select the second objective listed below.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Cripple or \emph{destroy} a 'Mech.

  \item Cripple or \emph{destroy} a ProtoMech.

  \item Cripple or \emph{destroy} a Combat Vehicle.

  \item Cause critical or motive damage on a VTOL unit.

  \item Kill at least half of the troops in an infantry unit.

  \item Successfully complete a Death from Above attack.
