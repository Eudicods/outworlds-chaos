Organizers will provide a contract for the event or allow commanders to select one of the two default contracts given below.
As described in the \emph{BattleTech: Mercenaries} box set and the \emph{BattleTech: Hinterlands} sourcebook, commanders may negotiate to adjust the terms of their contract.

The first default contract represents an independent unit.

\begin{description}

  \item \textbf{Base Pay}: 100\% Base Pay (step 7)

  \item \textbf{Support}: 0\% (step 1)

  \item \textbf{Transportation}: 100\% (step 9)

  \item \textbf{Salvage}: 100\% (step 13)

  \item \textbf{Command Rights}: Independent (step 11)

\end{description}

The second default contract significantly reduces the maintenance cost for commanders while also reducing salvage and transportation payments.

\begin{description}

  \item \textbf{Base Pay}: 100\% Base Pay (step 7)

  \item \textbf{Support}: Battle (step 7)

  \item \textbf{Transportation}: 50\% (step 7)

  \item \textbf{Salvage}: 40\% (step 7)

  \item \textbf{Command Rights}: House (step 7)

\end{description}
