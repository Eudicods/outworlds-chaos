Event play uses Scale 1 forces and is more suitable for playing multiple tracks in a large event, such as at a convention.

Organizers list the contract and tracks for the event, and commanders bring a force that meets the \ifthenelse{\equal{\outworldsMode}{mode-web}} {\hyperref[subsec:force_construction_scale_1]{Event Play Force Construction} rules}{\emph{Scale 1 Force Construction} rules (see p. \pageref{subsec:force_construction_scale_1})}.
Commanders may use the same force between multiple events, unless the organizers state a new force must be used.
All forces they must pay 300 SP in transportation costs, modified by the contract terms, to reach the planet for the event.
