\item {\bfseries Anti-'Mech Costs}: Some infantry units, such as Anti-'Mech jump infantry, can have particularly high C-bill costs.
The relatively low BV cost for these units can be exploited to give commanders disproportionate initial C-bills.
League organizers may reduce the Anti-'Mech Training and Equipment cost multiplier (see p.282, TM) from 5.0 to 2.0 to mitigate this issue.
Commanders multiply the C-bill costs of all units with Anti-'Mech training and equipment by 0.4 in this case.
