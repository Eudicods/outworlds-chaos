\emph{BattleTech: Total Warfare} and \emph{Alpha Strike: Commander's Edition} provide full rules for aerospace and artillery support.
Battlefield Support rules from \emph{BattleTech: BattleMech Manual} page 75 may be used to provide simplified aerospace and artillery support.
Off-board artillery rules from \emph{Alpha Strike: Commander's Edition} page 151 may also be used to provide simplified artillery support.

Scenarios may use Battlefield Support or off-board artillery rules if each side agrees.
When using Battlefield Support rules in \emph{BattleTech: Total Warfare} scenarios, each side receives the same number of Battlefield Support Points (BSPs) and may use them at any point during the scenario.

The following additional rules apply when using Battlefield Support or off-board artillery.

\begin{itemize}

\item The commander's force must have a unit capable of offering the support.

\item The commander must declare which off-map unit in their force is offering support during the scenario before using the off-map support rules.
The same unit must be used to provide this type of support for the rest of the scenario, unless this unit is destroyed.

\item The first successful use of Defensive Aerospace Support or Counter-Battery Support/Fire damages the attacking unit.
The second successful use destroys the attacking unit.

\end{itemize}

Counter-Battery Support is a new form of Battlefield Support.
Counter-Battery Support costs 3 BSPs and can only be used after enemy Artillery Support has been used.
The target number for Counter-Battery Support is 7.
Reduce the target number by 1 for each use of enemy Artillery Support where a friendly unit had LOS to the point of impact.
Reset the target number to 7 if the enemy artillery unit is destroyed by two successful Counter-Battery Support attacks.
