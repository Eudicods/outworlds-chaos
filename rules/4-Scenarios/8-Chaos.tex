\emph{BattleTech: Chaos Campaign} are free campaign rules provided by Catalyst Game Labs.
The Chaos Campaign rules are used for campaign content in \emph{BattleTech: Chaos Campaign: Succession Wars} as well as \emph{BattleTech: Spotlight On} and \emph{BattleTech: Turning Points} products and \emph{Shrapnel}, the BattleTech magazine.

Campaigns with Chaos Campaign tracks can be converted to \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} with the following steps

\begin{enumerate}

\item Pick the BV/PV limit for the track with highest Warchest Points (WP) track cost.

\item Determine the WP to C-bills conversion by computing (7,000,000 C-bills) $\div$ (6,000 BV/150 PV) $\times$ (BV/PV limit) $\div$ (Max WP track cost), rounding up.
For example, for a campaign with a max WP track cost of 300 WP where the largest track will be played with 8,000 BV, the WP to C-bills conversion is 31,112 C-bills per WP.

\item Determine the BV/PV limits for each track in the campaign.
For the example above, a track with a 300 WP cost would have a 8,000 BV limit and a track with a 100 WP cost would have a 2,667 BV limit.
If one side may only field a smaller portion of their force, set their BV limit proportional to the full limit.
For example, if the defender may only field 75\% of their force while the attacker may field up to 100\% of their force in a scenario with a 8,000 BV limit, then the defender may only use 6,000 BV.

\item Determine the C-bill payouts for objectives in the campaign.
In the example above, objectives worth 100 WP would earn 3,111,100 C-bills and 200 WP objectives earn 6,222,200 C-bills.

\item The optional Warchest costs can be added to any scenario at no C-bill cost, as long as these options do not grant additional forces or Battlefield Support to either side.
For example, an option that adds weather conditions may be selected while an option that adds a minefield may not.

\item Secondary objectives may be added, such as those given in the Casual Scenarios section.
The maximum C-bill payment should remain close to 10,000,000 C-bills for a 6,000 BV/150 PV track, or appropriately scaled for a track with different BV/PV limits.
However, some tracks intentionally pay out significantly more or less WP than their WP cost.

\item Additional rules or setup are included in some tracks.
These additional rules do not always fit well with \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} and Commanders will need to decide how to best meet the spirit of these rules.
All tracks should be converted, with all commanders agreeing with the conversion, before commanders begin the campaign.
