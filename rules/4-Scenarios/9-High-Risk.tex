A force can come close to destruction due to combat losses or bankruptcy.
The commander may stage a 'last stand' to save their force from ruin.
League organizers may authorize this optional rule for scoring.

For every 5\% of the full force's BV above 70\% that a commander brings to a scenario, they earn an extra 5\% C-bills payout.
For example, if a commander brings 90\% of their force to a scenario, they earn an extra 20\%.
The commander would receive 120\% of the C-bills earned in the scenario.

This rule may only be used when the force is under the starting BV limit of 10,000 BV and the starting balance of 3,000,000 C-bills.
This rule generally should not be used when the scenario BV/PV limit is 25\% or more above the standard limits of 6,000 BV for Total Warfare or 150 PV for Alpha Strike.
