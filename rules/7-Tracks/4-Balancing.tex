One of the goals of \emph{BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes} is to foster a friendly and welcoming environment.
A mix of experience levels between commanders is expected.
Here are some options to help balance tracks so game play is welcoming while also staying fresh and challenging:

\begin{description}

\item {\bfseries Setup}: When setting up a track, slight preference should generally be given to the commander whose force has the lower total BV, including all units and pilots.
For example, the commander with the lowest total BV could be offered the choice between attacking and defending.
For a track with a terrain setup phase, the commander with the lowest total BV could be offered the first placement of terrain pieces.

\item {\bfseries 2v2}: Many tracks are described as 1v1; however, these tracks often support team play, such as 2 players on each side.
When playing on teams, experience should be divided roughly equally between the two teams.
Teammates are encouraged to collaborate on strategy for the track.
