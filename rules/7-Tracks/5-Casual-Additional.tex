This list of casual objectives is not exhaustive.
Commanders may develop and play alternative tracks as long as the tracks are not intended to cheat the spirit of the rules or otherwise give the commanders unfair advantages.
Commanders are encouraged to develop tracks that match the lore of their forces.
For example, a pair of commanders for Clan forces may agree to a Trial of Possession or a commander of a Solaris VII force may challenge another force to a televised duel.

These objectives may be adapted to best support the narrative the players are creating, as long as all commanders agree.
Any additional restrictions or conditions for the track need to be agreed upon by all commanders before the track starts.
The outcome of the track may result in transfer of SP, personnel, or units between forces if that is agreed upon before the track starts.

These alternative tracks may include an SP payment but do not have to.
If the track includes an SP payment, it should stay close to the 100\% Base Pay limit for the Scale.
If the track is smaller than Scale 1, reduce the payment accordingly.
For example, a duel between two 1,500 BV 'Mechs could have prize of 250 SP for the winner.
