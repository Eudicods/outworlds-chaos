Tracks may be played wish \emph{BattleTech} or \emph{Alpha Strike}.
League organizers may use additional formats, such as BattleTroops.

Use the rules for the track format to define terms such as \emph{destroyed} and \emph{crippled} for the purposes of achieving objectives.

To convert a unit skill levels from BattleTech to Alpha Strike, take the average of the Piloting and Gunnery skills, rounded down (see p. 29, \emph{AS: CE}).
