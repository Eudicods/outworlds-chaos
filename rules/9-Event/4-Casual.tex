Event organizers may allow commanders to play additional casual scenarios between the official event scenarios.
Event organizers will provide a packet of casual play scenarios for the event, if they are allowed.

Commanders use their entire force for a casual scenario.
Commanders may temporarily modify the skill levels of their units to balance the BV of each side in a casual scenario.
The BV or PV of each side should be within 10\% of each other.

Each casual scenario will have a maximum of 5,000,000 C-bills in objectives payments.
A commander can accept either all of the objectives pay and repair costs or none of the objectives pay and repair costs.
Any objective pay from casual scenarios can be used to improve a force, so long as repair costs have been applied.
