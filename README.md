Outworlds Wastes is a casual BattleTech league framework with simplified logistics rules.
Players will take the role of commander of a mech force searching the Outworlds Wastes for lost technology and glory.
Completing objectives in scenarios will earn C-bills that commanders can use to upgrade their forces.
Different formats of scenario play are supported, to include Classic BattleTech, Alpha Strike, and BattleTech: Destiny.

The latest PDF of the rules can be found [here](https://github.com/Eudicods/outworlds-wastes/blob/main/league/outworlds-wastes-league.pdf).
