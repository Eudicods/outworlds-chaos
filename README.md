BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes provides rules for a casual BattleTech league and simplified campaign logistics rules.
Players take the role of a commander leading a combined arms force searching the Outworlds Wastes for lost technology and glory.
Completing objectives in scenarios earns C-bills that commanders use to maintain and upgrade their forces.
Commanders play scenarios in multiple formats, such as [BattleTech: Total Warfare][battletech-tw] and [BattleTech: Alpha Strike][battletech-as].

The latest PDF of the rules can be found [here][outworlds-pdf].
The Quickstart Rules PDF can be found [here][outworlds-quickstart].
The Event Rules PDF can be found [here][outworlds-event].
The web format of the rules can be found [here][outworlds-web].
