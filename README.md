![BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes][outworlds-wastes-logo]

BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes: Chaos Campaign provides a lightweight framework for narrative BattleTech leagues and events based upon BattleTech: Chaos Campaign from the Hot Spots: Hinterlands sourcebook or the BattleTech: Mercenaries box set.
Players take the role of a commander leading a combined arms force searching the Outworlds Wastes for lost technology and glory.
Completing objectives in scenarios earns C-bills that commanders use to maintain and upgrade their forces.
Commanders play scenarios in multiple formats, such as [BattleTech][battletech-tw] and [Alpha Strike][battletech-as].

The latest PDF of the rules can be found [here][outworlds-pdf].
The web format of the rules can be found [here][outworlds-web].
The original BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes rules can be found [here][outworlds-original].
