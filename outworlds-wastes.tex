\newpage

Outworlds Wastes is a casual Battletech league framework with simplified logistics rules.
Players will take the role of commander of a mech force searching the Outworld Wastes for lost technology and glory.
Completing objectives in scenarios will earn Battle Value points that commanders can use to upgrade their forces
Various forms of Battletech game-play are supported, such as Classic Battletech, Alpha Strike, and Battletech Destiny.

\section*{Goals}

\begin{itemize}

\item Have buckets of fun and foster a welcoming environment.

\item Give players an opportunity to build personalized lore for their own mechwarrior forces.

\item Provide a lightweight framework for players to track the growth and accomplishments of their forces.

\item Explore ilClan era lore and equipment.

\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Region Background}

The Outworlds Alliance was founded in 2413, and enjoyed prosperity throughout the Star League Era.
By the start of the Amaris Civil War in 2766, the Outworlds Alliance contained over 135 major systems across 7 administrative districts.
Like many nations, the Outworlds Alliance suffered during the Succession Wars that followed the fall of the Star League in 2780, and their holdings steadily dwindled.\\

Following their abjuration from the Clan Homeworlds in 3075 as a result of the Wars of Reaving, Clan Snow Raven took refuge in the Outworlds Alliance.
In 3083, Clan Snow Raven and the Outworlds Alliance merged to form the Raven Alliance.\\

By the ilClan Trial in 3151, the Raven Alliance contained approximately 47 systems.
At least 88 lost systems that were part of the Star League era Outworlds Alliance now form a region known as the Outworlds Wastes.
Many factions are eager to explore these lost worlds in search of lost Star League technology or to take refuge from the complex machinations of Inner Sphere factions.\\

\section{Overview}

You will take the role of commander of a mech force exploring the Outworld Wastes for your faction.
Common factions for the region include

\begin{itemize}

\item Raven Alliance

\item Draconis Combine

\item Federated Suns

\item Mercenary groups

\item Pirate gangs

\item Clan Dark Caste

\end{itemize}

Commanders should pick the faction they are most interested in representing.
While Outworlds Wastes scenarios will generally be focused on the lore of the major factions in the region, listed above, additional factions may have a small presence in the Outworlds Wastes.
For example, the Raven Alliance has relationships with nations on the far side of the Periphery, such as Magistracy of Canopus.\\

Commanders will compete with other factions in the Outworlds Wastes to grow their force and recover lost technology.
These scenarios will be primarily designed for Classic Battletech, but content for Alpha Strike and Battletech Destiny is also supported and will be included.

\newpage

\section{Force Management}

Unit commanders will start with an initial pool of Battle Value points (BV) they can use to purchase their initial mechs.
Participation in scenarios and accomplishing objectives will earn the force additional BV to spend on training their pilots, upgrading units, and acquiring new equipment.\\

BV costs for all units are listed in the \href{http://www.masterunitlist.info/}{Master Unit List}.\\

\subsection{Force Creation}

Commanders start with 5,000 BV to acquire initial mechs and pilots for their force.
Each force starts must start with 4 to 6 mechs.
Commanders are encouraged to use the typical unit composition of their faction but are not required to do so.
Forces do not start with non-mech units, such as battle armor, vehicles, or aerospace fighters.
Unspent BV is saved for future upgrades.\\

The BV costs of a mech includes any upgraded pilot skills.
Each mech pilot starts with Gunnery 4/Piloting 5.
One pilot may be upgraded to no better than Gunnery 3/Piloting 4, and one pilot may be downgraded to no worse than Gunnery 5/Piloting 6.\\

Commanders will always have sufficient non-combatant dropship assets to move their force, but these dropships cannot participate in scenarios.
Dropships capable of providing Battlefield Support need to be purchase per the rules on the next page.\\

Two sample initial forces are provided below; one force is a mercenary lance and the second force is a Raven Alliance star.
Pilot names are encouraged but not mandatory.\\

\subsection{Spending BV}

After earning BV from scenarios, commanders can spend BV to improve their force.
Possible improvements include

\begin{itemize}

\item Train: Pay the difference in unit cost to upgrade a pilot's skill levels.
For example, the Atlas AS7-D with a 4/5 pilot costs 1,897 BV while the Atlas AS7-D with a 3/4 pilot costs 2,504 BV.
A commander may pay 607 to train the 4/5 Atlas pilot to a 3/4 Atlas pilot.
Pilots cannot be upgraded past Gunnery 1/Piloting 2.

\item Repair: Pay 50\% of the BV cost, rounded up, to repair a \emph{destroyed} unit.
Pay 25\% of the BV cost, rounded up, to repair all structure damage to a unit that has not been \emph{destroyed}.
If the pilot survived the damage to the unit, the repair cost depends upon the BV of the unit with the pilot.
If the pilot was killed, the repair cost includes a 4/5 pilot.
The new pilot of the repaired unit can be trained as above.
Armor damage is repaired for free.
See Battletech: Total Warfare for the definition of \emph{destroyed} for different types of units.

\item Refit: Pay the difference in BV cost to refit a unit to a different variant.
A Phoenix Hawk PXH-2 with a 4/5 pilot is worth 1,145 BV.
A Phoenix Hawk PXH-1K with a 4/5 pilot is worth 1,073 BV.
A commander may pay 72 BV to convert a PHX-2 into a PHX-1K or to convert a PHX-1K into a PHX-2.
Omnimechs can be temporarily converted to a cheaper variant for a scenario for free, but refitting is required to use more expensive variants.
For example, the Carrion Crow C with a 4/5 pilot is worth 1,826 BV.
The Carrion Crow A is cheaper, at 1,622 BV, so a Carrion Crow C can be temporarily configured as a Carrion Crow A for a scenario.
However, a Carrion Crow B is more expensive, at 2,083 BV, so a Carrion Crow C would need a 257 BV refit to be converted to the Carrion Crow B variant.
Once the Carrion Crow C is refitted to a Carrion Crow B, the omnimech can be configured as a Carrion Crow A, B, or C for any scenario.

\item Purchase: Pay the BV cost to get a new unit.
A squad of 4 Fenrir Battle Armor with ER medium lasers can be purchased for 368 BV.
Note that this is the primary way to acquire Battlefield Support assets.
For example, purchasing a Long Tom LT-MOB-25 for 152 BV allows the force to use artillery support in scenarios.
Commanders are encouraged to purchase units from their faction list for the ilClan era on the \href{http://www.masterunitlist.info/}{Master Unit List}.

\item Salvage: Pay 50\% the BV cost, rounded up, to salvage units that you destroyed in a scenario.
A War Crow Prime with a 4/5 pilot costs 2,835 BV.
A salvaged War Crow Prime with a 4/5 pilot costs 1,418 BV.
The base cost for salvage uses a 4/5 pilot, but the new pilot of the salvaged unit can be trained as above.
Salvage is the primary way for commanders to get units that are not on their \href{http://www.masterunitlist.info/}{Master Unit List} faction list for the ilClan era.

\item Sell: Commanders can sell old equipment for 50\% of the BV cost, rounded up.
A Locust LCT-1E with a 4/5 pilot costs 553 BV and can be sold for 277 BV.
Commanders can earn 25\% of the BV cost for selling a unit instead of paying 50\% of the BV cost to repair the unit.
The salvaged War Crow Prime could be sold to earn 709 BV instead of paying 1,418 BV to repair it.

\end{itemize}

One of the goals of the Outworlds Wastes framework is to explore ilClan era equipment.
Commanders are encouraged to know where in the rulebooks other commanders can learn about the special equipment for units in their force.

\newpage

\section{Scenarios}

Commanders earn BV to spend on their forces through participation in scenarios and accomplishing objectives.\\

Scenarios can be played in different formats; however all outcomes will be tracked in BV.
Many of these scenarios can be played 1v1 or 2v2.
Common formats for the scenarios include

\begin{itemize}

\item Classic Battletech: Scenarios for this format will primarily focus on mid scale combat, with each side controlling approximately one lance with supporting assets.

\item Alpha Strike: Scenarios for this format will primarily focus on large scale combat, with each side controlling approximately one company with supporting assets.

\item Battletech Destiny: Scenarios for this format will focus on small scale combat, with each side controlling approximately one or two mechs.

\end{itemize}

Scenarios award BV in two ways, through participation and completing objectives.
The BV awarded in a scenario will tend to follow these guidelines

\begin{itemize}

\item Participation: Forces earn 10\% of the total BV of the units they bring to the scenario, with a minimum of 500 BV.

\item Objectives: Forces earn 1,000 BV for completing primary objectives and 500 BV for completing secondary objectives.

\end{itemize}

Outworlds Wastes scenarios will often be built to represent lore and objectives relevant to specific worlds in the Outworlds Wastes.
These scenarios will often include special bonuses, such as recovering equipment from the 61st Royal Jump Infantry Division so a commander can add an advanced jump infantry unit to their force for free.\\

The Outworlds Wastes framework also supports casual games between commanders to give their forces more chances to earn BV and glory.
Some generic scenarios are included here as examples.
BV awards for the scenarios listed in Battletech: Total Warfare and Battletech: Alpha Strike Commander's Edition below.

\subsection{Classic Battletech}

Five of the six scenario types from Battletech: Total Warfare are included here.
The Standup Fight does not fit the narrative nature of Outworlds Wastes.

\begin{itemize}

\item Extraction: Each side brings the same BV.
The attacker's primary objective is to extract the hidden asset by having a unit carry it to the attacker's home edge.
The defender's primary objective is to steal the hidden asset by having a unit carry it to the defender's home edge.
A secondary objective for all commanders is to cripple or destroy a unit carrying the hidden asset.
The secondary objective can only be awarded once per commander.

\item Breakthrough: Each side brings the same BV.
The attacker's primary objective is to reach their home edge, and the defender's primary objective is to prevent attackers from reaching that edge.
1,000 BV for the primary objective is awarded proportionally, based upon the percentage of the attacker's initial BV that reaches the attacker's home edge.
Crippled units may exit off any map edge, but only only exiting off the attacker's home edge counts towards the attacker meeting the primary objective.
The attacker's secondary objective is to cripple or destroy the defender's forces, and the defender's secondary objective is to preserve their force.
500 BV for the secondary objective is awarded proportionally, as above. 

\item Chase: The defending side brings double the BV of the attacking side.
The attacking side has a high value asset that moves as fast as their slowest unit.
The attacker's primary objective is to extract the high value asset by having it cross the attacker's home edge.
The defender's primary objective is to cripple or destroy the high value asset.
The attacker's secondary objective is to reach their home edge, and the defender's secondary objective is to prevent attackers from reaching that edge.
500 BV for the secondary objective is awarded proportionally, based upon the percentage of the attacker's initial BV that reaches the attacker's home edge.

\item Hide and Seek: The attacking side brings double the BV of the defending side.
The attacker's primary objective is to cripple or destroy every defending unit.
The defender's primary objective is to cripple or destroy one attacking unit for every defending unit.
Crippled units may exit off any map edge.

\item Hold the Line: Each side brings the same BV; attacker should have twice as many units as the defender.
The attacker's primary objective is to cripple or destroy every defending unit.
The defender's primary objective is to cripple or destroy one attacking unit for every defending unit.
Crippled units may exit off any map edge.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Alpha Strike}

Four of the five scenario types from Battletech: Alpha Strike Commander's Edition are included here.
The Standup Fight does not fit the narrative nature of Outworlds Wastes.

\begin{itemize}

\item Capture the Flag: Each side brings the same PV and similar numbers of units.
The primary objective of each side is to capture the enemy flag.
The secondary objective of each side is to defend their own flag.

\item King of the Hill: Each side brings the same PV and similar numbers of units.
The primary objective of each side is to control the objective zone.
1,000 BV is awarded proportionally based upon the number of turns the objective is controlled.

\item Hold the Line: The defender has 25\% more PV than the attackers.
The attacker's primary objective is to cripple or destroy every defending unit.
The defender's primary objective is to cripple or destroy one attacking unit for every defending unit.
Crippled units may exit off any map edge.
The defender's secondary objective is to hold the line for 3 turn for every 4 defending units.
The attacker's secondary objective is to force all defending units to retreat before their time limit.

\item Reconnaissance: Each side brings the same PV and similar numbers of units.
The attacker's primary objective is to locate all hidden objectives.
The defender's primary objective is to prevent the attacker from locating all hidden objectives.
1,000 BV is awarded proportionally for the number of hidden objectives located by the attackers.

\end{itemize}
